      <h3>Liveness</h3>
      <p>Build your JavaScript objects in a live, interactive world. No edit/reload cycle; in the tradition of Smalltalk, all Avocado programming is done live, while your program is running, so you get immediate feedback.</p>
    </td>
    <td class="front_page_big_cell">
      <h3>Directness</h3>
      <p>Forget "tools" like class browsers or object hierarchy trees. Avocado gives you all that functionality, but in a way that feels like you're getting your hands directly on your objects.</p>
    </td>
    <td class="front_page_big_cell">
      <h3>No Installation</h3>
      <p>No need to install anything on your computer; the Avocado environment runs in a standard web browser.</p>

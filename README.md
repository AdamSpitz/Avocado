A fork of [Adam](https://github.com/AdamSpitz)'s [Avocadojs](https://github.com/AdamSpitz/Avocado).  

Why? Because [forks are easier than direct contributions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=0SARbwvhupQ#t=1697s).  

This project doesn't (yet) have any documentation - contributions are welcome.  

See [here](http://avocadojs.com/ "avocadojs.com") for more project information.
